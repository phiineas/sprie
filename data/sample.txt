This is a sample text file for testing the sprie spell checker.

It contains some mispelled words like "recieve" and "seperate" that should be detected.
The spell checker should also find errors like "definately" and "occured".

Here are some technology-related words that might have errors:
- algorthm (should be algorithm)
- programe (should be program)  
- developement (should be development)
- compter (should be computer)

The spell checker uses a Trie data strcture to efficiently store and search through
the dictionary. It also implements the Levenshtein distance algorithim to provide
suggestions for misspelled words.

Some common grammar mistakes:
- Their going to the store (should be They're)
- The weather is quiet nice (should be quite)
- I need advise on this matter (should be advice)
- This will not effect the outcome (should be affect)

Let's test with some proper words too:
typescript, javascript, node, development, programming, algorithm, data, structure
